            <h1>Create a REST API with Node.js & Express</h1>
            <p>The objective of this project is to build the server­side
                component
                of a “movies” web application. The web application will
                provide users with access to information about different movies,
                directors, and genres. Users
                will be able to sign up, update their personal information, and
                create a list of their favorite
                movies.
            </p>
