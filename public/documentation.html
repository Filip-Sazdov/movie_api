      <h1>Create a REST API with Node.js & Express</h1>
      <p>The objective of this project is to build the server­side
        component
        of a “movies” web application. The web application will
        provide users with access to information about different movies,
        directors, and genres. Users
        will be able to sign up, update their personal information, and
        create a list of their favorite
        movies.
